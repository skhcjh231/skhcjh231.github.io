I am a integrated M.S & Ph.D. student in [graduate school of artificial intelligence](https://ai.postech.ac.kr/) at [POSTECH](https://postech.ac.kr/eng/), working as a member of the [Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/), advised by Prof. [Suha Kwak](https://suhakwak.github.io/).

My research lies in computer vision and deep learning including, but not limited to, video understanding, localization and its applications.
